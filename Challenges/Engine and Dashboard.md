# The Challenge

You work for a vehicle simulation company, and they've asked you to build a simplified simulated combustion car engine. They've also asked you to create an instruments dashboard for this engine that displays some common metrics that would be expected in a car.

Essentially, your goal is to: 
- Create a simulation of a car
- The engine should be able to receive analog input for throttle and braking
- There exists a linked "Dashboard" that is a 3D, representation of a car dashboard. All Dials should exist physically in the world, that is to say, this dashboard is not made up of UI elements. This dashboard should represent the simulated model of your combustion engine.
- The Dashboard should at minimum display Engine RPM and Speed
- NOTE: Your model does not have to physically move, but it'd be cool if it did 
- BONUS: Your engine and dash has other accessory simulated elements like fuel, gears, engine temperature, etc. Though try to add a dash element for the simulated element as well. 
- BONUS: Your engine can accept other inputs like a clutch pedal or a gear shifter.
- BONUS: you don't need to simulate a car, if you prefer another type of vehicle with the same type of simulation - representation relationship, like a plane, or other type of configuration, feel free to do so.
