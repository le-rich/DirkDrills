# The Challenge

You have a game that has a creepy squid-like creature. Your teammates want you to create an appendage that acts like a limb that can reach certain programmatic targets. 

Your animator teammate says that there should be at least 3 bones in this limb so that their squiggly limb vision can come to life.

Because you're a tech-art pro, you know that this solution calls for an *Inverse Kinematic Rig*

Challenge Requirements:
- Create or source a 3D model to act as a limb or Tendril 
- You need at least 3 bones in the limb 
- You need to set up inverse kinematics such that the last bone acts as an "IK Target" and will reorient the rest of the bone chain to satisfy its position
- You need to be able to export the skeletal mesh to a game engine and ensure the IK setup works
- BONUS: Set up a bone constraint on one of the bones in order to limit angle of rotation 
- BONUS: Set up a non-linear bone chain (has fingers or other branch bones)
