# The Challenge

Your game director is pretty art-pilled and cinema-core, him and a couple cinematic animators have been hard at work on an awesome intro sequence for a level and the whole team is pretty excited about the sequence. 

However, as the game currently stands, there is a huge boring load screen right when the cinematic ends, killing all immersion and mood.

The game director has tasked you with creating a seamless transition into gameplay from the cinematic, which the artists have already converted to being an in-game/engine cinematic. 

Your final solution should include:
- A scene that, when played, begins playing a cinematic sequence instantly
- Upon the sequence finishing, the camera should not cut from the cinematic, but instead transition to where it would be during gameplay
- The game should be controllable and playable right when the sequence ends with no cut, obvious reloading of state or reset of animation on the playable character
- BONUS: The controllable character is humanoid
- **ULTRA BONUS**: Somewhere in your solution, you're able to transition from gameplay to cinematic seamlessly. (For example, Red Dead Redemption 2 Mission Starts)
