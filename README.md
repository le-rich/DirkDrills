This vault/ repository serves as a collection of game development and 3D Graphics related challenges in order to develop and drill skills for these fields.
#### Why?
Often, developers are limited to the set of problems presented by their job or school, and it's often *optional* to synthesize many complex ideas into practical skills. 

I want to create a collection of classic problems that game developers run into, but in a way that combines theory and practical application in one exercise.
#### The Practice Mentality
These drills should be almost effortless, where we should give you all the setup files and theory required to apply, and it's up to the user to be creative and play with the scenario.

The goal is to also develop a sense of **Independent Thought** and **Problem Solving**. There may be some problems where requirements are left relatively open, interpret the solution as you see fit, and be creative. But do not do so at the cost of good engineering, design, or architectural sensibilities.

Try to have fun with the problems, nobody is forcing you to do these so don't force yourself. The moment it becomes tedious work, the less likely you are to enjoy these.
# How to use this Repo

This collection of Markdown files was built using Obisidian.md, a free notetaking software.

Opening the repo folder in obsidian will show a graph view of interconnected ideas that may or may not help the user. It also organizes files in way where links are visualized between a challenge and the topics they present.

Otherwise, the file structure should be organized sufficiently where navigating it will present you with relevant challenges to accomplish.
